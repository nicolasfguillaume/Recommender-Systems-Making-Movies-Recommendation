Making movies recommendation using a Collaborative Filtering Algorithm on the famous MovieLens dataset.  

Trying multiple approaches:

1. Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
2. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): work in progress
3. Advanced Matrix Factorization algorithms (SGD and ALS): work in progress
